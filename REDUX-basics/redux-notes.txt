Connecting React and Redux

1.) Install redux and react-redux
We can connect it via index.js file

a.) We define a store in index.js
b.) a reducer in store>reducer.js
c.) Wrap main <App /> inside Provider (imported from react-redux) and hook out store in it
    Provider is a helper component which help us to inject our store into the react components
    <Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>

d.) Add connect function to the Counter.js
    connect is a function which returns a function which then takes a component
    which is a high order component
    connect()(Counter);
    HERE we can pass which states we want in this container AND
    which actions do we need to perform 

A common syntax

HERE from that big object store we only get the states that we want and use it as props in our component

const mapStateToProps = state => {
    return{
        ctr:state.counter
    };
};
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);


# HOW can we change the counter now ?

<button onClick={this.props.onIncrementCounter} value="-5"> SUB 5</button>
                                OR
<button onClick={() => this.props.onIncrementCounter(-5)} value="-5"> SUB 5</button>

mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =>{
    return {
    onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({type:'DECREMENT10', val:1})
                OR
    onIncrementCounter: (val) => dispatch({type:'DECREMENT10', buttval:val})
    }


we can use combinedreducers to combine different reducers, more on this later? [IMP tho]
